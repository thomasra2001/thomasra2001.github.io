## About Me

My name is Tra Reynolds. I am a Senior Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Double Major at Auburn University. 

I hope to graduate in May 2025. My passion for research comes from my love of computers. One of the first words I learned to read was "Disney.com", as my mom tells me, from sneaking onto the computer at 3 years old.

I can be contacted at trr0026[at]auburn[dot]edu
